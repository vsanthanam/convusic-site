# Convusic Website

This is the website for [@ConvusicApp](https://www.convusic.app).

It is a single-page, client-side web app built with [react.js](https://reactjs.org), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
React has matured a lot since I last dabbled with it in 2018, and there are now a number of new frameworks better optimized for this usecase, like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com).

However, I didn't feel like learning a new tool, so this project was bootstrapped with [Create-React-App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) instead.

CRA has also matured since I last used it, and support for TypeScript and CSS preprocessors like SASS no longer require third party script packages. This project uses both.
